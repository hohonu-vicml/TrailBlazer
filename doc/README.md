# TrailBlazer: Wiki

Here we have a couple of pages describing the features of this repository to
support our TrailBlazer research. It includes:

* [**Command.md**](Command.md): To showcase the commands used in TrailBlazer
  from scratch

* [**Config.md**](Config.md): To illustrate the config structure between
  single/multiple objects synthesis. For single object synthesis, it supports
  both T2V-Zero, Peekaboo(New), and our TrailBlazer.

* [**Gradio.md**](Gradio.md): A visual guide to see how TrailBlazer works in
  Gradio app.

* [**Peekaboo.md**](Peekaboo.md): To show how we integrate Peekaboo into our framework.
